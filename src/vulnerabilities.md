# Vulnerability Scanning
Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weaknesses and flaws in systems and software running on them. 

## Vulnerability management process involves
* Identification of vulnerabilities
* Evaluation of the risk posed by any vulnerabilities identified
* Treatment of any identified vulnerabilities
* Reporting on vulnerabilities and how they have been handled

## External Scans
* how might an attacker get in
## Internal Scans
